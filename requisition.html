                    <p style="font-size:16px;">I chose to redesign Frontier’s Check In process because this was the last time I remembered I was truly frustrated at the design of an interface. Upon research, I discovered that Frontier does not have a responsive mobile web version of their website nor do they have a mobile application. For the purposes of this redesign, I chose to tackle the mobile web version.

                <p>As lead designer on this project, I was responsible for redesigning the entire flow of creating a requisition. Here is some insight into the work that I created and how I came up with the solutions that I did.

                    <h3>Problem</h3><br>
                        <p>As a recruiter or HR administrator at a enterprise company, there are a lot of moving parts and people involved in recruiting. It can get really messy.  A job requisition is central to the entire recruiting experience, which is why keeping information organized and fields easy to fill out is so important.</p><br>

                        <h4>Historically...</h4>
                        <p>Enterprise job requisition forms looked like this.</p><br>
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/Requisition/historical-jobreq.jpg"><br><br>
                        <p>Ours were no exception</p>

                        <h4>What's wrong?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Too many fields</b> - Our existing requisition form has 25 fields with user confusion as to what exactly they all meant. </li>
                            <li><b>Ungrouped fields</b> - Related fields were interspersed </li>
                            <li><b>Broken flow</b> - A user would have to go to 3 different places on the platform just to finish creating a requisition</li>
                            <li><b>No guidance</b> - It was unclear to the user what the next step was. </li>
                            <li><b>Unclear distinction</b> - Users didn’t know which fields would be public and which were private. This caused trust issues because of the severe consequences of disclosing sensitive information like salary data to public [eyes?]. </li>


                        </ul><br>
                        <h4>My Solution</h4>
                         <ul>
                            <li>To reduce the amount of fields</li>
                            <li>Group the fields into sections that had similar purposes to help the more easily form a mental model of how the data will be stored ??</li>
                            <li>Guide the user through clear steps instead of presenting it as one large step</li>
                            <li>Clarify what the purpose of each section as well as help the user understand the implications of their actions [questionable wording]</li>

                    <h3>Approach</h3><br>
                        <h4>Exploration and Research </h4>
                        <p>There were too many fields. My first task was to understand what each and every field's purpose was and group them accordingly. I interviewed stakeholders and began dissecting. On a Google Doc, I outlined and defined each element.  This way it is all laid out and I can easily organize them into buckets that make more sense. </p><br>

                        <h4>Rough Sketches / Brainstorming</h4><br>
                        <p>As part of our redesign, I also had to come up with a visual refresh of our new product. So, I spent around 30 minutes coming up with rough sketches of how to improve the way we present form elements. One big problem with our existing forms are using placeholders instead of labels. Especially in a long form, the user will want to review it afterwards, but they won't be able to read which field corresponds to which placeholder. <br><br>

                        The user will have to copy it to their clipboard, erase it, read the placeholder, and then pasted it back into the field for <i>each</i> field. </p><br>
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/Requisition/fieldRefresh.png"><br><br>

                        <p>This new design solves a a lot of problems. </p>
                        <ul><li>The label now very clearly indicates what the field is and what input is expected</li>
                        <li>I increased the height of the input field to 45px per Apple's recommendation of a minimum of 44x44 space to correspond roughly to a finger size. </li>

In the first iteration, I had previously placed the boarding time on the bottom.

                <!-- <p><b>Complete Check In- </b> I used a stepper control here, because its great for making small adjustments without having to waste any additional clicks. The vast number of travellers typically check around 0-2 bags, so a stepper would make sense. Interacting with drop down menus often requires more effeort than necessary. First, tap the control, scroll, find and select the option, and then exit. The stepper is simple and the function is clear.<br><br>

                With the seating, I wanted to do something different than what currently exists in airline check in processes. I personally hate having to remember if I got the window seat or if I'm stuck in a middle seat. This saves the traveller a click into the seat map, and helps make the check in process faster and easier.</p><br><br>

The look up process for a reservation typically takes longer, so I wanted to do something interactive and fun while the user waited. It also helps give the user visual feedback that it is doing something in the background. So, I thought this would be the perfect time to pick up Framer! I'm happy to say this is my first animation on Framer and I'm looking forward to doing more.</p> -->
