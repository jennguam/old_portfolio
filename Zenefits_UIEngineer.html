<!--
Create a web app (desktop or mobile) that provides a query box and a search button and then calls the Places Library for Google Maps (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places). Format the results to give a good user experience.

Please provide your program as a zip or tar archive, with an index.html file. Use whatever libraries, documentation, tutorials, or frameworks you consider necessary. This should be a client-side app, with little or no server code. Please include a README that gives us some relevant info about your program. Please spend around four hours on this assignment.
